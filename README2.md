# Patient Biodata Entry Form (Excel Project)

This project demonstrates how to design a structured and validated Excel form for collecting patient biodata in a healthcare environment.  
The goal is to reduce manual data-entry errors, enforce data quality, and prepare small facilities for EHR (Electronic Health Record) migration.

## 📊 Project Overview
This Excel file was built to simplify patient data collection using built-in Excel functions, without needing advanced coding or macros.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Patient ID Generation** – Generates unique patient IDs with text and incremental numbering.
- **Data Validation** – Ensures correct formats and prevents blank or invalid entries for key fields like Name, Date of Birth, and Allergies.
- **Dropdown Lists** – Simplifies entry for “Yes/No” fields such as known allergies.
- **Error Alerts & Input Messages** – Guides users with real-time feedback when incorrect data is entered.
- **Auto-fit Formatting** – Keeps the sheet visually clean and easy to navigate.
